# Principal Component Analysis
This project contains a Jupiter Notebook with Python scripts used to explore the breast cancer dataset in the sklearn library. The project involves structuring the variables into 2 using PCAs and developing a logistic regression model.

## System Requirements
- Jupiter Notebook

## Jupiter Notebook Setup Instructions
1. Download and install Jupyter Notebook (if not already installed) by running 'pip install notebook' in your terminal.
2. Launch Jupiter by running 'jupyter notebook'. A browser window will open.

## Running the Jupiter Notebook
1. In the browser or your preferred IDE, open the 'Principal Component Analysis' folder containing all files.
2. Select the PCA.ipynb file.
3. You can choose to run each cell individually or 'Run all'.
4. Follow each cell's output to have insights into the analysis of the data and the outcome of the model training.

## Files Included
- PCA.ipynb: Jupyter notebook
